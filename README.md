## Introduction

This project is all about recreating your very own (mini)shell, taking bash as reference. This was our first group project, and I was honored to do it with [@mbueno-g](https://github.com/mbueno-g) :)


#### What the Shell?

As we just said, we are asked to implement our own shell, but what is a shell to begin with? If we think (of for example) Linux as a nut or a seashell, the kernel/seed is the core of the nut and has to be surrounded by a cover or shell. Likewise, the shell we are implementing works as a command interpreter communicating with the OS kernel in a secure way, and allows us to perform a number tasks from a command line, namely execute commands, create or delete files or directories, or read and write content of files, among (many) other thins.

## Our Implementation of Minishell

The general idea for this shell is reading a string of commands in a prompt using [readline](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html). Before anything, it is highly recommended to take a deep dive into the [bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html), as it goes over every detail we had to have in mind when doing this project. ``Minishell`` involves heavy parsing of the string read by ``readline``, thus it is crucial to divide the code of the project into different parts: the ``lexer``, the ``expander``, the ``parser``, and lastly the ``executor``.
